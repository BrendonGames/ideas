# What is this?
This is a personal project for me to learn about frontend and backend web development with PHP and MySQL. This site is something I can use for when I get an idea, hence why it's called ideas. I personally host this via docker and protect the site with Authentik, due to no auth being build in (yet). 

# How to use
The site so far is pure PHP, so it's not that complicated. Just download the repo and adjust the example files to your needs. Due to me being to stupid to create a proper Docker image you need to do some things manually. To set up the database you need to import the layout. You can find the layout [here](https://ideas.brendongames.com/assets/ideas.sql). Just be warned that it's a simple project for me, so unless it actually takes off (in my dreams lol) I won't be putting much more effort into the public releases. 


# Plans
My plan so far is to just get something working and being able to add and edit ideas. Also custom sorting and searching are some things I'd like to add. If I feel like it, I may be able to add multi-user support, but that's a lot for a side project.

In case you're here, thank you for reading :3
